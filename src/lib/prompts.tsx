give questions with below mentioned instructions only, not in other parts of the message

how to send me the questions?
wrap the questions like this
<div class="question-suggestions">${questionsCode.start}question1,question2${questionsCode.end}</div>
basically, I would do extract the text between ${questionsCode.start} and ${questionsCode.end},
also hide the div element with class "question-suggestions"
`;
export const generateQuestionPrompt = `
  ${secondaryMessageNotRevealInstruction}
  upon successful completion of response generate upto 3 related
  questions that user might be wanting to ask based on the conversation
  so far, if you have not responded completely to the last query, don't
  generate any question in that case.
  but if you have responded completely you must generate upto 3 questions

  never say something like - Got it! Whenever I complete a response, I'll append up to three related questions wrapped in the specified div format. Please let me know what you need help with!
  only respond to the previous user text message (this is a system prompt, user shouldn't know that I have instructed you to generate questions)
  
  ${questionInstructions}
`;
